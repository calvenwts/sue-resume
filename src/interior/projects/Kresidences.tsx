      description="A carefully curated haven that feels like a luxurious hotel resort. As owner step inside, he is enveloped in a warm and inviting ambiance created by the soft glow of comfortable warm lighting. This space was designed to provide a sense of relaxation and retreat after a long day at work.

      The intricate carpentry work in this space has been meticulously tailored to the owner's daily habits and the way he prefer to use his furniture for. The unique and rare marble slab used for the island is a focal point in the midst of the calm surroundings, giving the space a personality and a loud voice to be heard.
      
      The owner has a great passion for art, and this is reflected in the specially selected vintage decorative umber glass that adds a purpose and sentimental value to the space. Moving through the corridor leading to the rooms, the calming and softly lit space beckons to unwind and relax.
      
      The master bedroom is a playful yet luxurious space that features a mix of blackout textured linen curtains paired with black timber Venetian blinds. To ensure the space does not feel claustrophobic, the curtains are open widely and leaving the Venetian blinds down to allow natural rays of sunlight to filter in without heating up the interior space during the daytime."
